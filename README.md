Sorry for the late submission.  I tried my best to get my original idea working, but I was having issues with the API.
Originally it was intended to store home addresses and values and allow the user to see all previously searched home values.
I simplified it to just take users input and find the home value for one home at a time; however, for some reason I could 
not get the user inputed values for city, state, and address in the Value class, to insert into url for the get command.

If you can give me any pointers, that would be great.
